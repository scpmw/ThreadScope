BUGS
- crash when zooming in too far (negative exponent)
- divide by zero (test overlap, zoom in, scroll right)
- vertical scrollbar slider is the wrong size
- when there are no events, we crash in last

- shift-click and drag to zoom to a region

- bookmarks
  - add/remove
  - save
  - measure the time between two markers
- search for events in the event window

UI
- get rid of oxs, use translation
- clip to expose region
- when the view has scrolled, use the previous rendered surface to render the
  scrolled part that is still in view
- render averaged areas properly
- indicate why a thread stopped somehow
- indicate when one thread wakes up another thread
