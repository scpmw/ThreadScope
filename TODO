TODO ------------------------------------------------------------------------

- move the ticks to the right drawing area
- get the vertical scrollbar working
- draw the background white when scrolling
- use createSimilarSurface?
- render each timeline independently, using translation

BUGS ------------------------------------------------------------------------

- crash when zooming in too far (negative exponent)
- when there are no events, we crash in last
- scrolling to the right, we get some over-rendering at the boundary
  causing a thick line
- scrolling when event labels are on chops off some labels
- fix event colours (key doesn't match)
- scrolling to the right at the end of the trace leaves an extra blue
  line at the top.
- fix the ticks: labels overlap sometimes

IDEAS ------------------------------------------------------------------------

RENDERING
- Draw event descriptions diagonally

NAVIGATION
- click and drag the view
- shift-click and drag to zoom to a region
- draw the detailed view in the background
- bookmarks
  - add/remove
  - save
  - measure the time between two markers
- search for events in the event window

UI
- render averaged areas properly
- indicate why a thread stopped somehow
- indicate when one thread wakes up another thread
- event list view
  - respond to page up / page down / arrows
  - interact with bookmarks  
- left pane for 
  - bookmarks
  - list of traces
    - traces would be a tree-view, e.g.
      * CPUS
        * 0
        * 1 etc.
      * Threads
        * 0
        * 1 etc.
      * Runtime
        * live heap
        * sparks
      * ETW / Linux Performance counters
        * cache misses
        * stalls
        * etc.
     - clicking on a trace adds that trace to the view, clicking again
       removes it
     - some way to reorder the traces?
     - when rendering threads, we want some way to indicate the time
       between creation and death - colour grey?

OTHER
- overlay ETW events
- colour threads differently
- thread names rather than numbers
- live heap graph
- spark pool size graph
- summary analysis
