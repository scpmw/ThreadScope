TODO ------------------------------------------------------------------------

- fix the status bar
- move the text entents stuff out of drawing ThreadRuns
DONE: - key is messed up

BUGS ------------------------------------------------------------------------

DONE: - crash when zooming in too far (negative exponent)
- when there are no events, we crash in last
- scrolling to the right, we get some over-rendering at the boundary
  causing a thick line
- scrolling when event labels are on chops off some labels
DONE: - fix event colours (key doesn't match)
- scrolling to the right at the end of the trace leaves an extra blue
  line at the top.
DONE: - fix the ticks: labels overlap sometimes
DONE: - don't draw overlapping labels

IDEAS ------------------------------------------------------------------------

NAVIGATION
- click and drag the view
- shift-click and drag to zoom to a region
- draw the detailed view in the background
- bookmarks
  - add/remove
  - save
  - measure the time between two markers
- search for events in the event window

UI
- render averaged areas properly
- indicate when one thread wakes up another thread, or a thread is migrated
  - draw lines/arrows between the events?
- event list view
  - respond to page up / page down / arrows
  - interact with bookmarks  
- left pane for 
  - bookmarks
  - list of traces
    - traces would be a tree-view, e.g.
      * HECs
        * 0
        * 1 etc.
      * Threads
        * 0
        * 1 etc.
      * RTS
        * live heap
        * sparks (per HEC ..)
      * ETW / Linux Performance counters
        * cache misses
        * stalls
        * etc.
     - clicking on a trace adds that trace to the view, clicking again
       removes it
     - some way to reorder the traces?
     - when rendering threads, we want some way to indicate the time
       between creation and death - colour grey?

OTHER
- overlay ETW events
- integrate strace events in the event view on Linux
- colour threads differently
- thread names rather than numbers
- live heap graph
- spark pool size graph
- summary analysis
