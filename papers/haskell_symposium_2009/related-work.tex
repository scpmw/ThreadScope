GranSim~\cite{loidl} is an event-driven simulator for the parallel execution of Glasgow Parallel Haskell (GPH) programs which allows the parallel behaviour of Haskell programs to be analyzed by instantiating any number of virtual processors which are emulated by a single thread on the host machine. GranSim has an associated set of visualization tools which show overall activity, per-processor activity, and per-thread activity. There is also a separate tool for analyzing the granularity of the generated threads. The GUM system~\cite{Trinder:gum} is a portable parallel implementation of Haskell with good profiling support for distributed implementations.
